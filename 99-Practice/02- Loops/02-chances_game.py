"""
Create a guess.py program and type in the following:

guess = 0

while guess != 6:
  guess = int(input("Guess the number:  "))

print("You got it!")

Run the code a few times so that you understand what it does.

Let's make it so that it's the same guessing game, but there is a new limit to the number of tries (it was infinite before).

First, introduce a variable called tries at the top and give it a value of 0.

Then, add a second condition with the tries variable to the while loop using a relational operator.
"""

guess = int(input("Guess the number : "))
tries = 0 


while guess != 6 and tries < 5 : 
  guess = int(input("Wrong , Guess the number again : "))
  tries+=1 

if guess == 6 : 
  print("You got the number, Good Job!")
else : 
  print("You ran out of the chances")
