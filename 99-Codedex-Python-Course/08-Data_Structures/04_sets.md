# Sets

We've now arrived at the fascinating realm of sets! 🪄

Sets are collections of unique items with no duplicates.

    They are an unordered collection of distinct elements.
    Each item in a set must be unique.

Unlike lists or tuples, sets do not have an inherent order, making them perfect for scenarios where the sequence of the elements is not important.

Sets are useful when dealing with unique elements and performing tasks such as:

    Working with a database of user profiles, each with a unique ID.
    Looking up only information with a unique tag attached to it.
    Searching for something and filtering out the results by category.

This makes sets great for finding unique items or eliminating duplicates.
# Creating Sets

Let's start by creating sets. You can define a set using curly braces { } or the set() constructor. Each set item is separated by a comma:

set_example = {val1, val2, val3}

The items in sets are in no particular order. This makes them handy for times when the order of items isn't important.

Let's set one up (pun intended):

fruits = {'🍎 apple', '🍌 banana', '🍊 orange'}

The fruits set contains three items, in no certain order.

Note: Dictionaries and sets can be made with curly braces but set do not use key-value pairs.
# Using Sets

Sets support various methods that allow us to combine sets, find common items, or filtering out items. This makes sets powerful for data manipulation.

There are three methods in particular:

    .union(): Combines two or more sets and returns a new set.
    .intersection(): Returns a set of items common to two or more sets.
    .difference(): Returns a set of items found only in the calling set.

Here are them in action:

set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}

# Union of sets
union_result = set1.union(set2)

# Intersection of sets
intersection_result = set1.intersection(set2)

# Difference of sets
difference_result = set1.difference(set2)

print(union_result)
print(intersection_result)
print(difference_result)

# Output:
# {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
# {3, 4}
# {1, 2}

# Methods

There are more set methods for common operations, like adding and removing elements:

my_set = {1, 2, 3}

my_set.add(4)
print(my_set) # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}

my_set.remove(2)
print(my_set) # Output: {1, 3, 4}

The .add() method adds one new item to a set. If that item already exists, nothing happens.

The .remove() method removes an item from a set if it exists.
