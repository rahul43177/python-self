# Dictionaries

Let's explore another data structure in Python: dictionaries!

Dictionaries are ordered collections that store and access data using key:value pairs.

Python dictionaries use curly braces { } with comma-separated key:value pairs:

dictionary = {
  key1: value1,
  key2: value2,
  key3: value3
}

With lists and tuples, we access their items by index. But with dictionaries, we access their items by key. 🔑

laptop = {
  'brand': 'Apple',
  'model': 'Macbook Pro',
  'size': 14,
  'year': 2023
}

Each key in a dictionary must be unique and associated with a specific value. This pairing allows for efficient retrieval of data. Keys must also be immutable, such as a string.

To access the value associated with a specific key in a dictionary, we use [ ] brackets with the key inside.

print(laptop['model'])
# Output: Macbook Pro

Consider a scenario where we are managing a database of artifacts or people, each with unique information.

Let's define a dictionary!

# Creating a dictionary
student_info = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 9, 'grade': 'A'}

# Accessing dictionary elements
print('Name:', student_info['name'])
print('Age:', student_info['age'])
print('Grade:', student_info['grade'])

# Modifying dictionary elements
student_info['age'] = 10
print('Updated Age:', student_info['age'])

# Dictionary Methods

Dictionaries come equipped with various methods to streamline common tasks. This includes .keys(), .values(), and .items():

# Dictionary methods
print('Keys:', student_info.keys())
print('Values:', student_info.values())
print('Items:', student_info.items())

This prints the following:

Keys: dict_keys(['name', 'age', 'grade'])
Values: dict_values(['Alice', 9, 'A'])
Items: dict_items([('name', 'Alice'), ('age', 9), ('grade', 'A')])

    .keys() returns just the keys from a dictionary.
    .values() returns just the values.
    .items() returns a list of the key-value pairs as tuples.
