# As one of the cultural capitals of the world, NYC is the home of the Met Museum. 🏛️
# It has one of the biggest art collections in the world!
# Let’s catalog an artifact from the museum! 🖼️ 👩‍🎨
# First, search the Met Museum site for your favorite artifact. Scroll to "Artwork Details" and let's start cataloging.
# On the Python editor, create a dictionary with the information of your artifact, including:
#     artist
#     period
#     date
# Lastly, print the dictionary. What do you see? What if we just want to print the keys, or the values?


artifact = {
    'artist' : 'Asian Artist' ,
    'period' : '15th Century' ,
}

for keys in artifact.keys():
    print(keys)

for values in artifact.values():
    print(values)


for key , val in artifact.items():
    print(f"key : {key} || val : {val}")
