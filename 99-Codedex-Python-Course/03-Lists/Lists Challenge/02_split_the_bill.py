Instructions
Suppose you and three of your friends all went out for a meal together. The bill comes due, and all of you decide to split the bill evenly.
Here is a Python list of prices for what was ordered:
bill = [13.99, 28.75, 9.99, 9.99, 6.95, 7.45, 16.45, 16.45]
Using this bill list, calculate the total amount and then divide it four ways.
Initialize the total with zero and loop through the bill list to add everything up.
With the total, store what each person has to pay in a my_share variable and then print the result to the terminal.

bill = [13.99, 28.75, 9.99, 9.99, 6.95, 7.45, 16.45, 16.45]

total = 0.0

for val in bill :
    print(val)
    total += val

my_share = total / 4
print(f"Split is : {my_share}")
