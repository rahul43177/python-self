"""
There is a common error in python when dealing with sequences called the IndexError. 
This is what happens when the index is our the of the range of a list. 

For exmaple : When we try to do vowels[5] in the below list : we will get something like this : 
vowels = ['a' , 'e' , 'i' , 'o' , 'u']

Traceback (most recent call last):
    print(vowels[5])
IndexError: list index out of range


We should be careful with this
