# The __init__() Method

Recall how we defined our Student class to model students:

class Student: 
  name = ''
  year = 0
  gpa = 0.0
  enrolled = False

daniel = Student()

However, it feels quite clunky because we need to give each attribute in the class a default or "dummy" value that doesn't actually get passed on to the objects we create.

print(vars(daniel))
# Output: {}

For example, the daniel object never received values from the Student class in the first place! We'd have to set them like so manually:

daniel.name = 'Daniel Li'
daniel.year = 10
daniel.gpa = 4.0
daniel.enrolled = True

Assigning a value to each attribute on a separate line is tedious; there must be an easier way! In fact, there is: we can use the __init__() method!

Using __init__() in our class definition lets us construct objects with unique attributes. When we create a new Student() object, we can pass in values for each attribute to initialize the new object, all in a single line!

So if we reformat our Student class with __init__():

class Student: 
  def __init__(self, name, year, gpa, enrolled):
    self.name = name
    self.year = year
    self.gpa = gpa
    self.enrolled = enrolled

daniel = Student('Daniel Li', 10, 4.0, True)

Note that __init__() also uses a separate parameter called self. This represents the object we'll create out of Student(). We need to include self whenever we want to use __init__(). It's always the first parameter.

With self, we can move each of the previous assignments, like daniel.name = 'Daniel Li', into the method and slightly rewrite it, like self.name = name.

Creating objects is now so much easier! If we want to create two more objects based on characters in Lady Bird, we just have to write:

ladybird = Student('Christine McPherson', 12, 4.0, True)
kyle = Student('Kyle Scheible', 12, 3.4, True)

print(vars(ladybird))
print(vars(kyle))

# Output: 
# {'name': 'Christine McPherson', 'year': 12, 'gpa': 4.0, 'enrolled': True}
# {'name': 'Kyle Scheible', 'year': 12, 'gpa': 3.4, 'enrolled': True}

The __init__ might be more effort upfront, but it saves us so much time if we create hundreds or thousands of the Student objects.
