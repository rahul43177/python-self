# Objects

Now that we know how to create a class, we can use it to create objects.

An object is an "instance" of a class. A class is simply a template for creating objects, which are individual copies of the class with actual values.

In the last exercise, we created a class to model students:

class Student:
  student_id = 0
  name = ''
  year = 0
  gpa = 0.0
  enrolled = False

Using the Student class, let's create an object to model the iconic Wednesday Addams of Nevermore Academy – a boarding school for outcasts and misfits.

The syntax for creating an object looks like this:

wednesday = Student()

Now that we have created an object of Student and saved it to wednesday, we can access and edit the class attributes by using the dot syntax, .attribute:

wednesday.student_id = 1113
wednesday.name = 'Wednesday Addams'
wednesday.year = 11
wednesday.gpa = 4.0
wednesday.enrolled = True

Wednesday Addams is a 11th-grade student with a 4.0 GPA and is currently enrolled. 🖤

You can check all the attributes available on the wednesday object with the built-in vars() function, as follows:

print(vars(wednesday))

# Output: {'student_id': 1113, 'name': 'Wednesday Addams', 'year': 11, 'gpa': 4.0, 'enrolled': True}

We don't have to stop there; we can create as many students as we want using just one Student class.
