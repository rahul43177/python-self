# The from Keyword
What if we wanted to import a piece of a module instead of the whole thing? We can use the from keyword!
At the top of our file, this keyword goes before the import keyword:
from module_name import objects
We can use the from keyword to import one or more objects from a module, such as built-in classes, methods, or variables.
The next example uses the from keyword to import random module's .sample() method that returns a list of values randomly picked from another list:
```python
from random import sample
famous_houses = [
  '🐺 Stark',
  '🐉 Targaryen',
  '🦌 Baratheon',
  '🦑 Greyjoy',
  '🦁 Lannister'
]
example = sample(famous_houses, 2)

print(f'Example: {example}')
```
Since the .sample() method was directly imported, we can just write sample() instead of the usual random.sample().
By the way, more than one method, variable, or class can be imported from a module on a single line.
If we want to import both the .choice() and .sample() methods:
```python
from random import choice, sample
```

Note: The random.choice() method randomly selects and returns a single element from a list.
# The as Keyword
Some module names are long, and it can be unpleasant to write the word repeatedly. This is where aliasing can be helpful!
We can nickname a module by using the as keyword. This is called aliasing.
For example:
```python
import random as rd
```
Here, we are renaming the random module with a shorthand, rd.
From this point of the program, the random module will be known as rd.
The from and as keywords can also be combined:

```python
from random import sample as samp
example = samp(['Stark', 'Targaryen', 'Baratheon', 'Greyjoy', 'Lannister'], 2)
print('Example: ' + example[0] + ' ' + example[1])
```
Instead of typing `sample()`, we can use the alias we assigned it to, `samp()`.
