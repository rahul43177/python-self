# Create Your Own Module

As discussed in a previous exercise, modules are essentially .py files that contain statements and definitions. So all of the files that were created for the exercises up to this point could be imported as a module!

For example, recall the math functions defined in a previous exercise.

If saved in a file called calculator.py, we could import it in a new file like so:

import calculator

Suppose we have another file called main.py, the functions from calculator.py (add(), subtract(), etc.) can be accessed and used with dot notation like so:

import calculator
import datetime

calculator.add(3, 4)        # 7
calculator.subtract(3, 4)   # -1
calculator.multiply(3, 4)   # 12
calculator.divide(3, 4)     # 0.75
calculator.exp(3, 4)        # 81

Note: The two files need to be in the same folder.
# datetime Module

Wait, what was that module? No, not calculator, the other one...

The datetime module specializes in dates and times. Just like random, it comes with Python by default and can simply be imported.

In addition to functions, modules may contain class object definitions with their own defined methods and properties.

The datetime module has a date object that accepts the following properties:

    .year: An integer between 1 and 9999.
    .month: An integer between 1 and 12.
    .day: An integer between 1 and the number of days in a given month.

The syntax for a date is datetime.date(year, month, day), like so:

import datetime

release_date = datetime.date(1991, 2, 20)
print(release_date)     # Output: 1991-02-20

The output shows the date object with a dash between each part. Also, any single number gets a leading zero 0.

The .year, .month, and .day properties can be accessed like with any other class object:

print(f'Python was released in {release_date.year}.')
# Output: Python was released in 1991.

Retrieving the current date is possible with the date.today() method:

datetime.date.today()
