Instructions

A gambling machine was invented in Brooklyn around 1891. Players would insert a nickel and pull a lever. If it's a good poker hand, you win a free beer. Soon, many bars in the city had it. This was a precursor to the modern slot machine.

Create a slot_machine.py program using random.

The items are symbols of common fruits and sevens (7️⃣). In each round, the slot machine displays three random items. If there are three sevens, you win!
